# ABOUT SUBMISSION

## Intro

A retro game based on the Terminator franchise. A top down shooter game with interactive enemies, difficulty progression, arcade style music and game sounds. Using solely the kaboom.js framework to implement various functions and colliding objects that combines to give the user a unique game play as well as nostalgic experience.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to produce a retro emulator game following the criteria set out by the hackathon facilitators and incorporating the hard work, skills and abilities of each team member while enjoying the process of learning to develop new and unique software.

- ➡️ To organise a group of strangers with varying abilities to join together to create an emulator type retro game from scratch using a new language and modern techniques.
- ➡️ The game will be disigned using a JavaScript frame work called Kaboom. It will be new to most of the team but will be a benificial learning curve for all involved.
- ➡️ The game will be aimed toward people born in or brought up in the 70s and 80s who fondly remember playing old emulator games on arcade machines in seaside amusement parks and any fans of the terminator franchise who grew up following the story behind John and Sarah Connor in their timeless battle against SkyNet.
